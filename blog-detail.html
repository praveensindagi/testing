        <p class="text-right">Policies and programmes must change restrictive gender norms in order to meaningfully impact the lives of
          women and girls.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <section class="blogDetailsContent">
      <div class="container">
        <p>In many societies, women’s choices around education, marriage, employment, and childbearing are severely
          limited and often prescriptive. Within homes, schools, work, and public places, critical life decisions are
          underpinned by social and gender norms that contribute to a widespread acceptance of discriminatory practices
          against women. Broadly understood, gender norms are ‘informal rules that impose expectations about behaviour
          that are dependent on gender’. Not only do these define socially acceptable behaviour, but they also have the
          power to influence expectations for men and women—directly affecting their choices, freedoms, and
          capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>Restrictive norms which fuel gender biases have been examined in social science research for the role they
          play in obstructing gender equality across multiple dimensions of politics, education, economics, and physical
          integrity ie. freedom from intimate partner violence and access to reproductive rights. Researchers also find
          that gender gaps favouring men over women are wider in developing countries.</p>
        <p>An important consequence of unequal gender norms is that they have the potential to minimise the positive
          impacts of a range of programmes designed to improve women’s health, educational attainment, employment, and
          financial inclusion, among others.</p>
        <p>Evidence from randomised evaluations suggests that to make meaningful changes in the fight against gender
          inequality, stakeholders must directly intervene to change biased gender norms in policy and programme design.
        </p>
        <h3>Why early marriage among girls persists</h3>
        <p>Norms favouring the early marriage of girls have resulted in its widespread practice and are correlated with
          negative health and education outcomes for women. One possible approach to successfully curb early marriage
          practices is accounting for the influence of parents on marital decisions.</p>
        <p>A study in rural Bangladesh tested whether providing conditional incentives for parents to delay their
          daughters’ marriage, empowering adolescents, or a combined approach could reduce child marriage, teenage
          childbearing, and increase educational attainment among adolescent girls. Girls whose families received
          conditional incentives (such as cooking oil), were 23 percent less likely to marry before the age of 18 and 13
          percent less likely to have children during their teenage years, relative to girls in communities without any
          programming. In comparison, while the adolescent empowerment programme—providing training in life skills,
          reproductive health, and financial literacy—had a positive impact on girls’ education, it failed to delay the
          age of marriage and childbearing.</p>
        <p>The limited impact of the adolescent empowerment programme on the age of marriage suggests that parental
          preferences and underlying gender norms are still relevant factors in marital decisions. Programmes that seek
          to end child marriage must leverage parents’ influence while approaches to empower adolescent girls may work
          better in contexts where young people have more control over their marriage choices.
        </p>
        <h3>Gender norms and women’s entrepreneurship</h3>
        <p>Social acceptance of men as the financial decision-makers tends to limit women’s control over their own
          earnings.</p>
        <p>A randomised evaluation in India, tested the impact of easing financial constraints, by providing loans with
          a grace period, to female micro-entrepreneurs in two types of households: ones in which women were the only
          entrepreneurs and those in which other members (typically male) also had a business. In households with
          multiple business owners, providing a loan with a grace period was able to increase business profits at the
          household level by around 45 percent. This, however, had no effect on female-run businesses. By contrast, when
          a woman was the sole entrepreneur in her household, the grace period contract increased her business profits
          by as much as 75 percent.</p>
        <p>These results—also found in countries such as Ghana and Sri Lanka—suggest that poor financial returns to
          female entrepreneurs occurred because women’s financial resources were often redirected to their husbands’
          businesses. Similarly, restrictive gender norms can also limit the impacts of skilling or financial access
          programmes. A study in Pakistan found that start-up loans and business training had limited success for
          female-owned enterprises, possibly due to expectations that women should only operate businesses from home and
          have minimal interactions with people outside the household.</p>
        <h3>Misperceptions of norms around women’s work</h3>
        <p>Certain ideas around how women are expected to behave may persist because people wrongly perceive and conform
          to regressive social norms. For instance, men might be publicly opposed to their sisters or wives driving
          independently, even if they privately believe otherwise. This is because they believe that society expects
          them to oppose it, and as a result end up acting against their own views. Such individual misperceptions can
          be damaging—particularly when the community or peer groups have progressive views.</p>
        <p>In Saudi Arabia, a study found that while a majority of men privately supported women’s participation in the
          workforce, they tended to misjudge the level of support within the community. Around 72 percent of men in this
          study underestimated other participants’ overall support for female labour force participation. Moreover, the
          wives of participants who were informed about their peers’ favourable opinions regarding women’s work, were
          significantly more likely to have applied for and interviewed for a job outside the home.
        </p>
        <div class="quote">          
          <h2><span>"</span>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nunc mi orci, malesuada et dolor sit amet, tincidunt consectetur augue. Mauris varius nisi arcu, a tincidunt velit euismod id.</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Another potential approach to change husbands’ attitudes towards women’s employment is to increase women’s
          financial control, thereby increasing their bargaining and decision-making power within the home. A study in
          Madhya Pradesh found that women’s labour force participation and their husband’s support for their work
          increased among women who were provided with their own bank accounts, training on how to use them, and a
          direct deposit of their wages (earned through the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme or
          NREGA).</p>
        <p>Affording women greater financial control allowed them to work more, have greater financial freedom, and
          express support for more progressive gender norms. Husbands were less likely to oppose women working for pay
          outside the home and less likely to perceive harsh social sanctions because their wives worked. In contrast,
          impacts were weaker when women did not receive bank account training or a direct wage deposit, indicating that
          financial knowledge and agency are needed to increase financial control.</p>
        <h3>
          Transforming gender norms early and effectively</h3>
        <p>Progressive policies can also target norms directly and be designed to change gendered attitudes and
          behaviours at an early age. Evidence suggests that increasing adolescent boys’ and girls’ exposure to
          gender-egalitarian curricula, can offer a viable and scalable pathway for changing norms.</p>
        <p>A randomised evaluation in Haryana studied the impact of interactive classroom discussions about gender roles
          and gender discrimination, held over two and a half school years, on the gender attitudes, aspirations, and
          behaviours of adolescent girls and boys.</p>
        <p>The programme, designed by the nonprofit Breakthrough, had a positive impact on both girls’ and boys’ gender
          attitudes and made them more supportive of gender equality. Students who initially held gender discriminatory
          attitudes changed their views to be more gender-equal in 16 percent of cases, with the largest impacts on
          attitudes towards women’s employment, education, and gender roles. The programme also led students to enact
          more gender-equitable behaviours, particularly among boys, who reported performing more household chores.
          Girls, however, did not report doing fewer chores. This suggests that boys are likely to have greater freedom
          to act on their gender-sensitisation education than female participants—underscoring the importance of
          sensitising boys early. Surveys also found that these positive effects on attitudes and behaviours were still
          present two years after the programme ended (when the students were, on average, 17 years old).</p>
        <p>These promising results have also prompted the Punjab government to implement the gender sensitisation
          curriculum for students from Grades 6 to 8 across 4,500 public schools in the state.
        </p>
        <p>By encouraging girls and boys to adopt more progressive gender roles, such programmes may have the potential
          to impact other phases of adolescents’ lives and set the stage for more positive life outcomes for women in
          the future. While the longer-term effects of this programme are yet to be measured, this programme may also
          have intergenerational effects in the future.</p>
        <h3>
          Making gender equality the norm</h3>
        <p>A vast majority of Indian women and girls have been living in conditions of low empowerment and agency,
          despite overall economic growth. Not only do deeply entrenched norms limit girls’ opportunities within and
          outside the home, but they can also undo the desired effects of programmes and policies designed to improve
          women’s lives.</p>
